Data Collection Tree One of the most common data structures used around is a tree. You are tasked with building the same which can collect data and aggregate on some dimensions and metrics. Consider yourself as an administrator for a website which has traffic globally from different devices. 
In this case, your dimensions are: 
  1. Country: Represented by a string like IN,US,KR etc
  2. Device: Represented by a string like Mobile, Desktop, Tablet You have a couple of metrics as well on these dimensions
Metrics are the actionable values that a user generates. Some examples of the same are: 
 1. WebRequests: Represented by an integer denoting the number of times a request has been made to a website 
 2. TimeSpent: Represented by an integer which denotes the time spent in seconds by users on the website
